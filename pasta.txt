Lisp, Pascal, C# and other languages will come if others post

If you intentionally want yours posted, please:
>indent correctly (1 tab = 4 spaces)
>specify the language
>any 3rd-party libraries (if any needed)
>compiler arguments (if any needed)
>what license to publish
>if filename affects the program 
(ex: in Java, myProgram.java will only work if the main method is in [code]public class myProgram[/code])
If the project spans multiple files, post a Dropbox, Google Drive, Mediafire, ..., or GitHub link so the source code can be added in one folder in the repo.

If you do not want yours hosted outside your own repo, we can also link to yours if you'd like.
