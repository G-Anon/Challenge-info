[JUST CREATED, WAIT FOR NEXT COMMIT FOR FULL INFO]

These 100 programming challenges contain various problems proposed by anons on /g/ that are geared to either teach new programmers simple CS concepts or give a bored NEET something to do in their basement for the weekend besides Chinese cartoons.

Difficulty can vary from simple math and recursion to an implementation of some CS theorem or a game clone.
Once you do all of the challenges, you should be able to do all of the following:

- Program fluently in whatever language you learned
- Use 3rd-party libraries to create a project of our own
- Take a 1st-year CS course in the college of your choosing without really learning anything new
- Create your own full-fledged program to distribute and monetize
